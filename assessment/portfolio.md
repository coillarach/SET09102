## Coursework Specification

For this assessment, you will build up a portfolio of work on a weekly basis.
To generate your portfolio entries, you will sometimes need to work with others
as a Scrum team. Scrum was covered in the
[Software Engineering Methods module](https://github.com/edinburgh-napier/SET08103/blob/main/units/unit01/unit01b.md).
If you have not done that module and you are not already familiar with Scrum, make this
known to the rest of your team during the practical session in week 2. The other
members of the team will then be able to support you.

The portfolio entry for each week has a close relationship with the scheduled practical
work. Your portfolio should showcase your work in such a way that it could be shown to
potential employers. It will take the form of a personal GitHub repository that is 
distinct from the repository of the team you are working with. To get started, you can
clone the [template repository](https://github.com/edinburgh-napier/SET09102_portfolio/tree/main). 
The template provides a basic structure with an initial Readme page and an entry for 
each week of the module. The weekly pages contain some prompts for suggested content, 
but you are free to adjust the actual content as appropriate. There are two essential
requirements for each portfolio entry:

* Evidence of the work completed in the form of - for example - screenshots, links to 
  other content on GitHub, explanatory comments, etc.
* Reflection on the work of the week including - for example - strengths, weaknesses,
  challenges, limitations, potential improvements, etc.

## Submission

You should create each portfolio entry during the corresponding week. The deadline for 
entry submission is 0900 on the Monday of the following week. For example, the entry
for week 2 needs to be submitted by 0900 on the Monday of week 3.

You create a portfolio entry as a [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) page in 
your GitHub repository. In addition, you are required to export the markdown page to 
pdf and submit the resulting document to Moodle by the appropriate deadline.

To create a pdf version of your page

1. View the page in GitHub
2. Right-click on the page
3. Select **Print...**
4. Set **Destination** to *Save as PDF*
5. Set the filename and destination directory
6. Save

## Marking

Your portfolio will be marked out of 100 with each week worth 10 marks.
Five marks are awarded for timeliness and five marks for the quality of the entry.

### Timeliness

If an entry is submitted before the deadline it will receive five marks. Thereafter,
one mark will be deducted for every day (or partial day) that the entry is overdue.
For example, if an entry is submitted at 1200 the following Wednesday, it is late
by two full days and three hours. The additional three hours constitute a partial day
and therefore only two marks will be awarded in that case.

### Quality

Although some tasks require more effort than others, there are five marks available
for the entry quality in all cases. The key to getting good marks under this criterion
is attention to detail. Your entry should provide a clear and objective account of the 
actual work done as well as a coherent reflective commentary. You should aim for
clarity of structure, readability of the content and an appropriate professional 
writing style.

## Formative feedback

Module tutors and demonstrators will be on hand during the practical sessions to
provide feedback on your portfolio entries either after submission or before. You
should take advantage of this to ensure that your work is achieving the expected 
level of quality.
