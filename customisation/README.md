# Customisation

The material in this repo is designed to be viewed as a set of 
[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}. The default style
and behaviour is modified with the use of custom css and javascript which can be
found in the `assets/` directory.
The documentation in this folder explains how to use the additional features 
consistently.
