# Links


By convention, links to other documents in this repo follow the default behaviour 
of replacing the currently viewed page.

External links on the other hand are opened in a new window/tab. This is achieved
by adding an additional directive to the end of the markdown link as shown below.

``` markdown
[Link text](https://www.bbc.com){:target="_blank"}
```
