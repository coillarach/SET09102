# Images

The convention is to format images as figures unless there is a good reason
not to. Figures are numbered starting at 1 within each tutorial. If a tutorial
spans more than ne page, figures numbers should be unique across all pages.
Fro example, if the last figure on the first page is Fig. 5, then the first 
figure on the second page should be Fig.6.

Template:

```markdown
  ![Image alt text](images/image_file.png#figure)
  <figcaption>Fig. 1. Caption text.</figcaption>
```
